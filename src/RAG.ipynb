Another tip is choosing to eat dry beans,  peas, or soy products as a main dish. Some of the menu choices  include chili with kidney and pinto beans, hummus on pita bread,  and black bean enchiladas. You could also enjoy nuts in a variety of  ways. You can put them on a salad, in a stir-fry, or use them as a  topping for steamed vegetables in place of meat or cheese. If you do  not eat meat, the USDA has much more information on how to get  all the protein you need from a plant-based diet. When choosing the  best protein-rich foods to eat, pay attention to the whole nutrient  package and remember to select from a variety of protein sources  to get all the other essential micronutrients.  Protein Quality  While protein is contained in a wide variety of foods, it differs in  quality. High-quality protein contains all the essential amino acids  in the proportions needed by the human body. The amino acid  profile of different foods is therefore one component of protein  quality. Foods that contain some of the essential amino acids are  called incomplete protein sources, while those that contain all nine  essential amino acids are called complete protein sources, or high- quality protein sources. Foods that are complete protein sources  include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and  meat, and a few plant foods, such as soy and quinoa. The only  animal-based protein that is not complete is gelatin, which is made  of the protein, collagen.

Water As a Lubricant/Shock Absorber  Many may view the slimy products of a sneeze as gross, but  sneezing is essential for removing irritants and could not take place  without water. Mucus, which is not only essential to discharge nasal  irritants, is also required for breathing, transportation of nutrients  along the gastrointestinal tract, and elimination of waste materials  through the rectum. Mucus is composed of more than 90 percent  water and a front-line defense against injury and foreign invaders.  It protects tissues from irritants, entraps pathogens, and contains  immune-system cells that destroy pathogens. Water is also the main  component of the lubricating fluid between joints and eases the  movement of articulated bones.  The aqueous and vitreous humors, which are fluids that fill the  extra space in the eyes and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding  the brain and spinal cord, are primarily water and buffer these  organs against sudden changes in the environment. Watery fluids  surrounding organs provide both chemical and mechanical  protection.

In general, animal-based  proteins are completely broken down during the process of  digestion, whereas plant-based proteins are not. This is because  some proteins are contained in the plant’s fibrous cell walls and  these pass through the digestive tract unabsorbed by the body.  Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid  Score (PDCAAS)  The PDCAAS is a method adopted by the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) to determine a food’s protein quality. It is  calculated using a formula that incorporates the total amount of  amino acids in the food and the amount of protein in the food that  is actually digested by humans. The food’s protein quality is then  ranked against the foods highest in protein quality. Milk protein, egg  whites, whey, and soy all have a ranking of one, the highest ranking.
